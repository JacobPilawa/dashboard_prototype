# things to fix
- remove things on bottom / replace bottom text
- change description on homepage and title of homepage
- on puzzler pages:
	- compute ranking by jpar, 
	- remove PT Rank, Z Rank, Percentile Rank, Average Rank Score boxes
	- make it Overall Rank, JPAR Value, Number Events; then second row 


other ideas to implement:
- for each puzzler page, show their times relative to the distribution in little squares/post it things
-
